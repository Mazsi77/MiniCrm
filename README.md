# Mini CRM Application

We made a Mini CRM Application for company management, where we could manage leads, opportunities and their activities.
Customer relationship management (CRM) software is a tool you can use to store and manage data about your leads, sales opportunities etc.

## Technologies used:
  - PHP ( OOP and MVC pattern)
  - MySQL ( DB )
  - Bootstrap
  - JQuery.js

## Included:
  - Authentication system
  - CRUD functionality (Create / Read / Update / Delete) for Leads, Opportunities and Activities
  - Bootstrap-based design theme
  - Leads DB table consists of these fields: name, email, telephone, join_date
  - Opportunities DB table consists of these fields: name, amount, prob, date, close_date, lead_id, stage_id
  - Activities DB table consists of these fields: description, type, deadline, is_done, opport_id


We uploaded the application, to our Apache HTTP Server.
The data transmission take place with SFTP, which is a file transfer protocol built upon the SSH.
